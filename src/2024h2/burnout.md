## Motivation

Burnout is a common issue in the rust project, particularly amongst individuals
in team member / maintainer roles. Burnout causes a great deal of harm to these
individuals, and resolving this burnout requires a change to their environment[^1],
either by resolving the issues in their current environment that caused their
burnout, or much more commonly, by leaving that environment altogether,
stepping down from those roles. This has a significant negative impact on our
organization's ability to function and retain expertise.

### The next few steps

- Continuous investment into burnout prevention[^2]
- Monitoring
- Awareness
- Direct Action based on specific cases
- Policy based on patterns that emerge

### The "shiny future" we are working towards

We want to work in a project where we feel the impact of our work. Where we
have opportunities to work on projects that interest us and where the process
of doing that work is joyous and enriching. Where it's clear what we should be
working on and we feel empowered to do that work. Where we don't feel pressured
beyond our capacity to do work that we aren't interested in "for the good of
the project". A project where we feel safe to talk about problems that need to
be addressed and where we feel these conversations lead to actual resolutions.
A project that resolves conflict constructively. A project where we trust each
other and the goals we share.

## Design axioms

* **It is far easier to prevent burnout than recover from it**

## Ownership and other resources

**Owner:** NEEDED[^3]

* An expert in burnout to help with making resources, trainings
    * yaahc: I am a victim, not an expert, and I do not wish to do the research to become an expert on burnout, I want to get back to writing software.

### Support needed from the project

* Blog posts
* Surveys
* Participation of members of all teams in trainings and monitoring, particularly those in leadership roles
* In person events, a sense of community support

## Frequently asked questions

### What do I do with this space?

*This is a good place to elaborate on your reasoning above -- for example, why
did you put the design axioms in the order that you did? It's also a good place
to put the answers to any questions that come up during discussion. The
expectation is that this FAQ section will grow as the goal is discussed and
eventually should contain a complete summary of the points raised along the
way.*

[^1]: teams and roles
[^2]: Think teams, roles, responsibilities, culture. for example, having checking for burnout amongst team members become a responsibility of leadership roles, or having a norm of talking at in person events about our experiences with burnout and how it often shows up in the project.
[^3]: I believe that taking this on myself would likely exacerbate my existing burnout
